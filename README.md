# Deep Learning in EEG
## 02466 Project Work | s20xxxx, s20xxxx and s20xxxx
The following is the repository for the Deep Learning in EEG project.
The project is a part of the course 02466 Project work - Bachelor of Artificial Intelligence and Data, which is mandatory for the completion of the B.Sc.Eng programme Artificial Intelligence and Data (Kunstig Intelligens og Data) at the Technical University of Denmark.

The main part of the repository is the pipeline folder. Here, you will find all the utility functions needed for carrying out the experiments described in the 'Experiments' section. The python script pipelineMain.py is the main script for the project and is used to run the whole dynamic pipeline. This is the only file needed to be run in order to carry out the experiments.

All dependencies for the project can be found in and installed with the requirements.txt file. 

To reproduce our results, use the seed 42 and the following dataset. 

## Data
In order to run the experiments, you need to download the TUH EEG Artifact Corpus v2.0.0, which is freely available at Temple University here: 
https://www.isip.piconepress.com/projects/tuh_eeg/html/downloads.shtml

## Preprocessing
To preprocess the raw .edf EEG data files, we use preprocessing tools made available by David Nyrnberg. The tools can be found at the following repository:

## Experiments
More to come...

- **this experiment**
- **that experiment**
  - **the other experiment**


## Credits
The project was carried out by s20xxxx, s20xxxx and s20xxxx.
