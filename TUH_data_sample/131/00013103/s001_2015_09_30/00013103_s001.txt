History:	52 year old woman with liver failure, now with episodes of left face and arm
Medications:	no AEDs, meropenem
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Extended, >60 min, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, comatose
Description:
There is no PDR or AP gradient.  The background consists of attenuated very slow delta activity and
frequent high amplitude independent bilateral posterior quadrant sharp waves with aftergoing
slow waves.  Frequent electrographic seizures are captured over the bilateral posterior quadrants,
right>>left.  They last from ~ 25 seconds to up to 5 minutes.  Right hemispheric seizures start with
O2 (and O2/P4) low amplitude rhythmic activity in the sleep-spindle range that frequently evolves
and spreads to T6 lead.  Similar activity is seen over the reciprocal left hemispheric leads during
the left hemispheric seizures.  These seizures occur multiple times per hour.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, severe
Sharp waves, frequent, bilateral posterior
Status epilepticus, bilateral (R>L) posterior
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL ~2 hour continuous video EEG due to (1) severe diffuse slowing, (2) frequent
independent bilateral posterior quadrant epileptiform discharges and (3) frequent recurrent
synchronous and independent bilateral posterior quadrant (right> left) seizures without clinical
correlate.  This finding is indicative of moderate to severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is
etiologically nonspecific.  There are epileptogenic structural foci over the posterior quadrants.
These findings were conveyed to the neurology consult team and  patient was placed on
continuous EEG monitoring.  However, the decision was made to withdraw care, so the prolonged
